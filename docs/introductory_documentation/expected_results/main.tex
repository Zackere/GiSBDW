\section{Expected results}
\paragraph{\\\\General thoughts\\\\}
As we mentioned before we are going to try a few variants with diffrent degree of complexity and in this point we are not sure if we manage to accomplish all of them. The most uncertain variant is bound and branch algorith on GPU as this alogorithm seems to be very hard to be made parallel. As a result it may not be possible to provide  GPU implementation for hybrid algorithm, but it is not sure, we will try to figure it out.\\\\
\paragraph{Dynamic\\\\}
We most likely will manage to do dynamic algorithm both GPU and CPU implementation and the GPU implementation of dynamic algorithm will probably perform very well as long as memory will allow it to do so. We predict that the limits on memory will be reached for graphs with around 30 vertices. The exact value depends on union-find structure implementation.\\\\

\paragraph{Bound and branch\\\\}
This algorithm has higher complexity than dynamic algorithm and most likely it will perform worse than dynamic algorithm, however it does not have limits on memory as its memory complexity is polinomial. It is very possible that we will manage to provide CPU implementation, but because of its recursive nature it may cause a lot of trouble to accomplish GPU one.\\\\


\paragraph{Hybrid\\\\}
This algorithm has similar complexity to Bound and branch algorith as Bound and branch is main part of it, but we assume that it will perform way better than its basic version because of \emph{endings} precalculated by dynamic algorithm.
Most likely we will provide CPU implementation. Unfortunately, we think that the GPU implementation is very unlikly to be accomplished.
