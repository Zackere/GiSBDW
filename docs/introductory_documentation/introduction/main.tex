\subsection{Tree-depth definition}
For undirected graph $G$, the tree-depth $td(G)$ is a graph invariant. Intuitively, we may think of it as the parameter that says how similar the graph is to a star. The lower tree-depth is, the more "starlike" $G$ is.
Tree-depth value can range from 1 to $|G|$.
To explain the most common tree-depth definition, it is necessary to introduce term tree-depth decomposition. Tree-depth decomposition of graph $G$ is a forest $F$ with the following property:\\\\
\emph{If there is an edge $uv$ in $G$ then vertices $u$ and $v$ have ancestor-descendant relationship between each other in $F$.}\\\\
Using this definition, the tree-depth of $G$ is a depth of the forest with minimal depth among all tree-depth decomposition of $G$.\\\\
Tree-depth is also be defined in recursive manner. It is worth to mention because we make strong use of it in our dynamic algorithm, presented later in this documentation. The definition looks as follows:\\\\
\begin{equation}
td(G) =
\begin{cases}
1 & \text{if $|$G$|$=1}\\
1+min_{v \in V} td(G-v) & \text{if G is connected}\\
max_{i} td(G_{i})  & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}       
\end{equation}
\\\\
\subsection{Examples}
In this paragraph I will provide some obvious facts and examples of tree-depth decompositions in order to give reader a better intuition.\\\\
The only connected graph which tree-depth equals to 1 is complete graph \emph{K$_{1}$}\\
Stars are the only connected graphs with tree-depth equal to 2.  For these graphs, graph and its best tree-depth decomposition is the same thing.\\\\
Antoher thing is that for every graph $G$ a trivialy valid tree-depth depcomposition of $G$ is a path $P$(where $|P|=|G|$) rooted in its beginning. It is true, because for such a tree every pair of vertices have ancestor-descendant relationship to each other.\\\\
The last fact, to point out is that if $G$ is connected then its tree-depth decomposition $F$ is also connected. It is true, because if $F$ had two components, then there would be two groups of vertices in $G$ without edges between each other, which is contradictiory to $G$ being connected.
